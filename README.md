# 🌤 Flutter Weather App  

## 📌 Overview  
I developed a **Flutter-based Weather App** that provides **real-time weather updates** using the **Weather API**. The app allows users to check the current weather conditions of any location with an interactive and user-friendly interface.  

## 🚀 Features

- 📍 **Location-Based Weather Tracking** – Fetches weather details based on the user's current location.  
- 🎨 **Dynamic UI Elements** – Weather icons and backgrounds change based on live conditions.  
- 🔎 **Search Functionality** – Users can search for weather updates in any city worldwide.  

## 🛠 Tech Stack  
- **Framework:** Flutter  
- **State Management:** Provider / Riverpod (if applicable)  
- **API:** Weather API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap API)  
- **UI Components:** Flutter Widgets
